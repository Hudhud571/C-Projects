I updated my personal portfolio and GitHub README to showcase the projects I completed in this course. My portfolio highlights key C# projects, including Insurance Qoute and basic Entity Framework Code-First console application, and links to GitHub.

In my GitHub README, I included an overview of my skills, such as C#, .NET, and API development. I also added instructions on how to run my projects.

This update helped me organize my work and present my progress as a C# developer in a clear and professional way.
